Dear Manager,
	Our team would like to propose a project to you that we have recently been formulating. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), we are looking to find predictive factors that indicate the income level people will reach in their life. This NLSY79 data was collected starting back in 1979 with a group of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 14 and 22. Since then, they have surveyed this same group of people regarding topics such as their family background, education, and income. Although many people were dropped from the survey over the last 40 years, there are still almost 10,000 participants in 2021.
